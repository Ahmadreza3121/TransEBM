&ebm_configuration 
! Default configuration for EBM
! CAUTION: If anything is NOT in the format that fortran expects (say 100.0 where an int is expected), than everything past that point in the configuration
!          will not be read out!!!!!!! (instead code will run with parameters from default_config there)

! [map]
! File that contains the world map to be used, has to be simple text file containing numbers 1 = land, 2 = sea ice, 3 = land ice, 5 = ocean
! has to be formatted such that it matches the resolution of the finest grid (NY& = latitude = 65, NX6 = longitude = 128)
! WORLD: folder that contains the map(s)
! ICE: folder that contains the ice map(s), if they are provided  separately (everywhere there is ice, ice will be put according to this, everywhere else map will be used)
! ICE_MAP: whether a separate ice map is provided
! ICE_EBM: whether the sea-ice should change dynamically in EBM

!            format is (lower, upper, step), each in ppm, EBM will be run for all CO2 ranging from lower to upper with step as stepsize, either by taking the 
!            corresponding CO2_FILE for each CO2 value (if CO2_FORCED == true) or the CO2 value itself (if CO2_FORCED == false)

! S0_VALUE: format is (lower, upper, step), each in W/m^2, EBM will be run for all S0 ranging from lower to upper with step as stepsize, either by taking 
!           the corresponding S0_FILE for each S0 value (if S0_FORCED == true) or the S0 value itself (if S0_FORCED == false)
! S0_SIGMA: standard deviation in W/m^2 for normal distribution from which noisy S0 is read
! S0_FILE: file for noisy S0 forcings if S0_FORCED == true, has to be without file ending (which will be .txt), since more info will be added to the filename
! S0_FILE_LEN: contains entries to be read from s0 file (important for RESTARTs)
